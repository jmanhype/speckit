# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Beads Integration for Work Memory - RECOMMENDED

**All long-running work and discovered tasks SHOULD be tracked as Beads issues:**

- `tasks.md` is for intent, structure, and indexing (NOT for storing the full backlog)
- Beads stores the actual work with dependencies, notes, and discoveries
- Each task in `tasks.md` SHOULD reference its Beads issue ID: `- [ ] (bd-xxxx) T001 ...`
- Implementation SHOULD be driven from `bd ready` (not just markdown checkboxes)
- Discoveries during implementation SHOULD create new Beads issues (not expand tasks.md)

**Beads Workflow:**
1. Before `/speckit.specify`: Search Beads for prior work (`bd search`, `bd list`)
2. During `/speckit.plan`: Create epic issues for each phase
3. After `/speckit.tasks`: Create Beads task issues and link IDs in `tasks.md`
4. During `/speckit.implement`: Drive from `bd ready`, update both Beads and `tasks.md`
5. End of session: Store discoveries and blockers in Beads for next session

**Rationale:** Beads provides persistent memory across sessions that survives context limits, enabling long-running projects with AI agents.

**See:** `AGENTS.md` for detailed Beads + Spec Kit workflow.

### II. Test-First Development (TDD) - RECOMMENDED

**All code MUST be developed using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
- Tests MUST be written before implementation code
- Tests MUST fail initially (Red phase)
- Implementation MUST make tests pass (Green phase)
- Code MUST be refactored after passing (Refactor phase)
- Test coverage MUST be ≥90% for all modules
- Test coverage MUST be 100% for security-critical code (auth, authorization, data access)

**Rationale:** V1 had 70% coverage with 100+ tests written but not implemented. V2 enforces TDD to prevent technical debt and ensure correctness from the start.

**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- Contract tests for all external service adapters
- Property-based tests for complex algorithms (verification, gap analysis)
- Accessibility tests for all UI components (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance tests for critical paths (gap analysis, vector search)

### II.A Test Pass Gate - MANDATORY

**100% of all tests MUST pass before any work is considered complete:**

| Test Type | Pass Rate Required | When to Run |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Unit tests | 100% | After each task |
| Integration tests | 100% | After each user story |
| Smoke tests | 100% | Before any deployment/demo |

**Enforcement Rules:**
- A task is **NOT complete** if any relevant test fails
- A user story is **NOT complete** if any integration test fails
- A feature is **NOT shippable** if any smoke test fails
- Existing tests MUST NOT regress (no breaking previously passing tests)
- Flaky tests MUST be fixed or quarantined immediately (not ignored)

**Smoke Test Definition:**
Smoke tests verify critical user paths work end-to-end:
- User can authenticate
- Core CRUD operations function
- Critical integrations respond
- No 5xx errors on happy paths

**Failure Protocol:**
1. If any test fails → STOP, fix before proceeding
2. If fix is non-trivial → Create blocking issue, do NOT skip
3. NEVER mark work complete with failing tests
4. NEVER disable tests to "make progress"

**Rationale:** Coverage measures what's tested; pass rate measures what works. 100% pass rate is non-negotiable.

### II.B SOLID Architecture - MANDATORY

**All code MUST adhere to SOLID principles:**

- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class/module has one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification (use interfaces/protocols)
- **L**iskov Substitution: Implementations must be substitutable for their abstractions
- **I**nterface Segregation: Many focused interfaces over one general interface
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, inject implementations

**Architectural Patterns REQUIRED:**
- **Repository Pattern:** All data access via repository interfaces
- **Adapter Pattern:** All external dependencies isolated behind adapters
- **Factory Pattern:** Service creation via dependency injection
- **Strategy Pattern:** Algorithm selection (classification, verification, caching)
- **Facade Pattern:** Simplified interfaces to complex subsystems

**Rationale:** V1 successfully refactored from 1,233-line god object to SOLID architecture. V2 enforces this from the start.

### III. Security-First Design - NON-NEGOTIABLE

**Zero-trust security MUST be enforced at every layer:**

**Defense in Depth (Multiple Layers):**
- **Layer 1: Network** - Rate limiting, DDoS protection
- **Layer 2: Authentication** - JWT + OIDC, MFA support
- **Layer 3: Authorization** - Cedar/OPA policies, RBAC, ABAC
- **Layer 4: Data Access** - Row-Level Security (RLS), tenant isolation
- **Layer 5: Application** - Input validation, output encoding, SQL injection prevention
- **Layer 6: Audit** - Hash-chained audit logs, WORM storage

**Security Requirements:**
- All secrets MUST be in environment variables or secret managers (NO hardcoding)
- All authentication MUST use industry-standard protocols (OIDC, OAuth2)
- All authorization MUST use policy engines (Cedar or OPA)
- All data MUST be encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- All inputs MUST be validated with Pydantic models (strict mode)
- All database queries MUST use ORM or parameterized queries (NO string interpolation)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) MUST be enabled in production
- All API endpoints MUST have rate limiting
- All errors MUST NOT leak sensitive information in production

**Rationale:** V1 had critical security fixes (tenant leakage, hardcoded secrets, mock auth). V2 prevents these by design.

### IV. Compliance by Design - MANDATORY

**System MUST be designed for compliance from day one:**

**Target Certifications:**
- **SOC 2 Type II:** Trust Services Criteria (Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy)
- **HIPAA:** Business Associate Agreement (BAA) ready, PHI handling procedures
- **GDPR:** Data privacy, right to deletion, data portability

**Compliance Requirements:**
- All user actions MUST be logged in immutable audit trail
- Audit logs MUST be hash-chained for tamper detection
- Audit logs MUST be stored in WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) storage
- Data retention policies MUST be configurable per tenant
- Data deletion MUST be verifiable and complete
- Provenance tracking MUST be complete (requirement → document → chunk → gap)
- License scope enforcement MUST be backend-enforced (not client-side)

**Rationale:** V1 implements ALCOA+ provenance and audit trails. V2 extends this to full SOC 2/HIPAA compliance.

### V. API Versioning & Stability - MANDATORY

**All APIs MUST be versioned and backward-compatible:**

**Versioning Strategy:**
- URL versioning: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`
- Version in Accept header: `Accept: application/vnd.rcst.v1+json`
- Semantic versioning for API: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - MAJOR: Breaking changes
  - MINOR: New features (backward-compatible)
  - PATCH: Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

**Stability Requirements:**
- Breaking changes MUST be announced 6 months in advance
- Previous MAJOR version MUST be supported for 12 months after new version release
- Deprecation warnings MUST be included in responses
- Migration guides MUST be provided for breaking changes
- API contracts MUST be documented with OpenAPI 3.1

**Rationale:** V1 lacks API versioning. V2 prevents breaking changes for existing clients.

### VI. Observability & Monitoring - MANDATORY

**System MUST be fully observable in production:**

**Three Pillars of Observability:**
- **Metrics:** Prometheus metrics for all critical operations
  - Request rates, latencies (p50, p95, p99), error rates
  - Database connection pool usage, query latencies
  - Cache hit rates, Redis latency
  - LLM API calls, costs, latencies
  - Business metrics (gap detection accuracy, confidence scores)

- **Logging:** Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
  - All requests logged with tenant_id, user_id, trace_id
  - All errors logged with full context (non-sensitive)
  - Log levels: DEBUG (dev), INFO (prod), WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL

- **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
  - All API requests traced end-to-end
  - Database queries, cache operations, LLM calls instrumented
  - Trace sampling: 100% errors, 10% success (configurable)

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Health checks MUST be implemented (`/health`, `/ready`, `/live`)
- Alerts MUST be configured for critical errors
- Dashboards MUST be created (Grafana or equivalent)
- SLOs MUST be defined and monitored (99.9% uptime, p95 < 500ms)

**Rationale:** V1 has basic observability. V2 requires production-grade monitoring for enterprise use.

### VII. Graceful Degradation - MANDATORY

**System MUST degrade gracefully when dependencies fail:**

**Degradation Strategy:**
- **Critical Path:** Core functionality continues with reduced features
- **Non-Critical Path:** Feature disabled with clear user messaging

**Fallback Requirements:**
- LLM provider failure → Failover chain (OpenAI → Anthropic → Ollama) → Heuristic classification
- Vector search failure → Full-text search → Manual review required
- Redis failure → In-memory cache → Performance degradation warning
- OIDC provider failure → Cached JWKS (max 5 minutes) → Fail closed
- Verification engine failure → Heuristic verification → Flag for manual review

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
- External service calls MUST have circuit breakers (open/half-open/closed states)
- Timeouts MUST be configured for all external calls
- Retries MUST use exponential backoff with jitter
- Max retries: 3 for idempotent operations, 0 for non-idempotent

**Rationale:** V1 has some graceful degradation. V2 requires comprehensive fallback strategies for enterprise reliability.

### VIII. Code Quality Standards - MANDATORY

**All code MUST meet high quality standards:**

**Static Analysis:**
- **Python:** mypy (strict mode), ruff, black, bandit (security)
- **TypeScript:** ESLint (strict), Prettier, no any types
- **SQL:** sqlfluff for migrations

**Code Review:**
- All changes MUST be peer-reviewed before merge
- Security-sensitive changes MUST be reviewed by security team
- Breaking changes MUST be reviewed by tech lead
- Code review checklist MUST be completed (security, performance, tests, docs)

**Documentation:**
- All public APIs MUST have docstrings (Google style)
- All complex algorithms MUST have inline comments explaining "why"
- All architectural decisions MUST be documented in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- All breaking changes MUST have migration guides

**Performance:**
- All API endpoints MUST complete within 500ms p95 (excluding long-running tasks)
- All database queries MUST be optimized (no N+1, proper indexes)
- All critical paths MUST be profiled and optimized

**Rationale:** V1 has good code quality. V2 enforces these standards via CI/CD gates.
